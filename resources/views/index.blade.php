            Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, centered on a film series created by George Lucas.
            It depicts the adventures of various characters "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away". <br>
            The franchise began in 1977 with the release of the film Star Wars (subtitled Episode IV:
            A New Hope in 1981, which became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. <br>
            It was followed by the successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi
            (1983); these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was released
            between 1999 and 2005, which received mixed reactions. <br>
            A sequel trilogy began in 2015 with the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
            All seven films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two films)
            and have been commercial successes, with a combined box office revenue of $7.471 billion,
            making Star Wars the third highest-grossing film series. Spin-off films include Star Wars:
            The Clone Wars (2008) and Rogue One (2016), which is the first in an upcoming series of anthology films. <br>

            The series has spawned an extensive media franchise—the Star Wars expanded universe—including books,
            television series, computer and video games, and comic books, resulting in significant development of the
            series's fictional universe. Star Wars also holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful
            film merchandising franchise. In 2015, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at USD $41.9 billion,
